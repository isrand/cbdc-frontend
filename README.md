# CBDC POC Frontend

This repository contains a sample project I have been working on in order to learn Angular in a weekend.
It's a basic bank UI that connects to a Hyperledger Fabric Token SDK powered network in order to facilitate transfer and requests of tokens, digital euros (Dâ‚¬) in this case.

I'm happy with the result and how much I managed to get done in a couple of days! Some best practices are ignored or outright unknown, so there is a lot to do still. However, the basic functionality to transfer funds to the same node and other nodes is already there.

## Setup

```
npm install
```

## Running the frontend

```
ng serve
```

Go to http://localhost:4200
